# PAVLOV

- Personal Analytical Virtual Lab on VM

These files were developed to quickly spin up a virtual machine (usually with VirtualBox) for teaching workshops or hacking on a new project.

The fabfiles can be run by navigating to the fab/pavlov directory and entering the command 'fab' followed by the function name.

For example, the core dependencies can be installed with
    fab install_core
